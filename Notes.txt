Demonstration of abstraction (higher-level methods that abstract unnecessary details)


Demonstration of inheritance (parent/child classes)
- Managers are derivedd from a Singketon class which in turn derives from MonoBehaviour


Demonstration of polymorphism (method overriding or overloading)
- Managers override the Singleton OnDestroy() method but utilize base.OnDestroy().


Demonstration of encapsulation (getters and setters)
-The NameSelf() class encapsulates the _baseName property
